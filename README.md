Presentation
-----------------
The presentation is built to help people understand some of the basics of Amazon Alexa skills. There is much more to learn and potentially more content to come in the future. Take the presentation for any needs you may have like a hackathon or training. 

Resources
-----------------
The resource folder hows to pdfs to help you design speech dialogues. I will update links & content that will help teach the basics. Please submit a link or a document if you would like me to reference something.

Template
-----------------
This is the starter template that I recommend using for Alexa skills. It is a [fork off](https://github.com/rmtuckerphx/alexa-skill-serverless-starter-template/tree/master) of  Mark Tuckers Serverless Starter Template. It is by far a complete starter template out there and packs a ton of features in it. I have simplified it for my need here to aim towards beginners.

Examples
-------------
I will load in some impressive examples repositories that others have created all in one place for your use. By all means, please go to the original reports if you want the most updated code. In no way am is green pioneer claiming ownership of any of the code. Merely trying to place all of the things for a beginner in a single location.
